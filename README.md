# 👥 Human Resource Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This Power BI dashboard was developed to help the **HR department track and manage staff information** more efficiently. Previously, staff data was stored in **monthly Excel files**, making it difficult to monitor updates and take timely action.

The dashboard consolidates key HR data — such as **position details, gender breakdown, assignment location, salary grade, and mobility records** — into one **centralized interface**. It enables faster, more consistent tracking of staffing movement and helps HR professionals verify staff changes (e.g., transfers, upgrades, attrition) with confidence.

## 🔐 Confidentiality Note  
*All data shown has been anonymized or recreated to maintain company data confidentiality. Visuals are intended to demonstrate layout and dashboard features only.*

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- HR staff had to **manually review different Excel files each month** to track staff info  
- Staff mobility and changes (e.g., transfers, promotions) were difficult to verify at a glance  
- No centralized view of staff status, assignment, or demographic breakdown  

---

## ✅ Solution  
This dashboard provides a **unified view of HR staff information**, allowing users to:  
- 🔍 **Search staff** by name or staff number  
- 📊 Monitor **filled vs vacant positions**, **roles by salary grade**, and **assignment locations**  
- 🔁 Track **staff mobility, progression, and attrition**  
- 📅 View **month-by-month changes** using a dynamic time slicer
